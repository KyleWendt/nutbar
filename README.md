NUshellx Transitions from Binary ARrays - a tool to calculate one and two-body transition densities from the results of the nuclear shell model code NuShellX. Operators produced by Ragnar Stroberg's IMSRG code are then combined with the densities to obtain (reduced) matrix elements of the operator in the shell model wave functions.
